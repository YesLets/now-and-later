Liv's 1st message to Audrow (2021-10-20)
==============================================
Hello Audrow, what is happening in your world? 


About Liv's world today (2021-10-20)
************************************
The temperature is 17C (62.6F) with mostly cloudy skies.
Today I read the wikipedia entry on RST. It still sounds like Greek.

I also learned that I don't have to write a **print statement** to do a hello world (like I had to do in python). Instead, I can use RST syntax.
